# Zemoga Javier Vasquez UI test

UI test project presented to Zemoga with ❤️ by Javier Vasquez, you can see it running [here]().

## 💼 What's included

You'll find a front end app. The root of the project also includes a `package.json` used to add `eslint` and `prettier` for the app.

### /app

This app includes the UI and all the client side related stuff, it's build with:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/): To build the html and user interactions.
- [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/): It's like SCSS with drugs. it combines the awesomeness of css with React.
- [moment.js](https://momentjs.com/): I had to show a date.

## 🚀 Deployment

```
> yarn
> yarn start

```

Then the running app will be running at http://localhost:3000

That's it!. 🎉
